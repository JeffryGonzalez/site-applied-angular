# Using an Outbox

This is a demonstration of creating a *outbox* for sending changes to the API "behind the scenes", thus creating non-blocking interactions for the user.

## Getting the Sample Code

You can download the sample code for this by finding yourself a nice clean directory on your machine and running

```sh
npx gitpick JeffryGonzalez/site-applied-angular/tree/main/projects/angular-reference/state
cd state
npm i && code .
```

## Overview of the Outbox Pattern

Here is a high-level overview of the *Outbox Pattern*.

## Code Explanation

In the example shown above, I implemented this using an `HttpInterceptor`. This allows the baseline functionality without the need for a lot of boilerplate code.

> In `projects/angular-reference/state/src/shared/state/interceptors.ts`

<<< ../../projects/angular-reference/state/src/shared/state/interceptors.ts

The Angular `HttpClient` allows you to attach data to a `context` property and retrieve that data in an interceptor.

That context data looks like this (in `projects/angular-reference/state/src/shared/state/types.ts`):

```ts
export type HttpMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';
export const OUTBOX_SOURCED = new HttpContextToken<
  | {
      method: HttpMethod;
      kind: 'deletion' | 'addition' | 'update';
      body: unknown;
      name: string;
    }
  | undefined
>(() => undefined);
export const OUTBOX_SOURCED_ID = new HttpContextToken<string>(() => '');
```

To append the context metadata, indicating the desire for the outbox pattern, add context to any Http request.

Each feature should have a feature name, to differentiate it in the outbox from any other features using that same data.

There is a helper in `projects/angular-reference/state/src/shared/utils.ts` that you can use with the HttpClient, as in `projects/angular-reference/state/src/outbox/product-api.ts`

<<< ../../projects/angular-reference/state/src/outbox/product-api.ts

To augment your store, you can use the `withOutbox` store feature, giving it the the `FEATURE_NAME` from the API, and a reference to the entities (here I'm giving it a pre-sorted list of entities).

This course will help level that line for consistent delivery of features your company needs. The Angular framework has evolved along with our experience in building durable, resilient applications. This course teaches developers how to write their best Angular apps.</p><p>The course will culminate in an extensive mentored lab that will give the students the opportunity to apply the concepts from the classroom while working together, and as part of a team of developers contributing to the application.</p><h2 id="buzzwords-covered" tabindex="-1">Buzzwords Covered <a class="header-anchor" href="#buzzwords-covered" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Buzzwords Covered&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>State Management with Angular Signals</li><li>User State in an application</li><li>Angular Components and Angular Directives: How to Choose</li><li>Designing reusable component and directive libraries</li><li>RXJS and Observables</li><li>API Access Patterns including caching, validation, and Authentication / Authorization</li><li>Advanced Routing: Route Guards, Lazy Loading</li><li>Branch by Abstraction for Angular in a CI/CD environment with feature flags.</li><li>Additional technologies demonstrated:</li><li>Zod for data validation</li><li>Angular (Tanstack) Query for secure, efficient API access</li><li>NGRX Store / NGRX Signal Store</li></ul><h2 id="prerequisites" tabindex="-1">Prerequisites <a class="header-anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prerequisites&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For this course, you are expected to have experience with Angular. You should know the general ontology of Angular - components, routing, services, etc. You should be comfortable with TypeScript and the Angular CLI. We will use Visual Studio Code as our development environment in this course. You should also have at least a beginner understanding of source code control with Git.</p><h2 id="objectives" tabindex="-1">Objectives <a class="header-anchor" href="#objectives" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Objectives&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The objectives of this course are to help you create Angular applications that have some internal logic and resiliency. All code has churn - we make changes all the time. User-facing applications like we build with Angular tend to have a high rate of change <em>and</em> they have to accommodate the changes on the backing services they use that may or may not be maintained by the same team.</p><h3 id="refactoring-for-consistency" tabindex="-1">Refactoring for Consistency <a class="header-anchor" href="#refactoring-for-consistency" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Refactoring for Consistency&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We will start the course with an existing Angular application.

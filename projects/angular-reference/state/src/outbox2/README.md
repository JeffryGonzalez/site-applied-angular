# Outbox 2 Story

- [ ] Move the error handling stuff out of the outbox
  - [ ] But might leave the dead letter thing in... think about this (could be good for "Dev tools")
- [ ] The Providers Thing
  - [ ] a "Root" provider to enable it across the application (like "withStore", etc.)
  - [ ] Features can add it in (so dynamically adding and removing interceptors?)

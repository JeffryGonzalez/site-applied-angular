# Snippets

The sample project has several snippets created in the `.vscode/typescript.code-snippets` file. They are:

## Create an Angular Component: `ngc`

Use this to create a new Angular component in a TypeScript source code file.

## Refactor an Angular Component: `ngrc`

Cut some of the content from a template into yor clipboard. Create a new TypeScript source code file and use the `ngrc` to create a component with the content of your clipboard in the template.

To stub out the routes for a routed feature, you can  use the `ngfr` snippet.

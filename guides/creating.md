# Creating an Angular Application


There is plenty of documentation at the [Angular.dev](https://angular.dev) site for creating a new Angular application with the Angular CLI's `ng new` command. 

You may want to have a "template" you use for all your new Angular applications.

Mine is located at https://github.com/HypertheoryTraining/angular-starter.  There are instructions at the bottom of the `README.md` for using this template, or you can watch this short video.

I try to keep it pretty up to date, and it has *some* of the things I find useful in most of my Angular applications.

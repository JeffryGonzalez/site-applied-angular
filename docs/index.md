# Applied Angular Development

Use the links to the left to navigate the site content.

This site is a collection of resources, notes, and guidance based on the instructor's best effort to provide great instruction for developers using Angular in building applications in an Enterprise Environment.

That guidance will change over time. New things will become available, we'll learn better ways to do things, etc. In other words the things you learn in class won't stay the same, so book mark this and come back often.

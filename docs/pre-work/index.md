## Updating your Angular Skills

This course assumes you have some prior training and experience with Angular. 

If you are unsure of your skill level, or wish to review before class, the following tutorial 
will help you identify areas you may need to "brush up" on prior to attending class to allow you to get the most out your training.

Depending on how up-to-date you skills are, you may find some things you need to research. For example, *Signals* are fairly new to Angular and are the preferred component-level state management primitive now. We will cover signals briefly in class, and much of the code we create will rely on them. [You can read more about Signals Here](https://angular.dev/essentials/signals#).

Deborah Kurata has a great (free!) YouTube Playlist with tons of details about Signals [Deborah Kurata, YouTube Signals Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqYQG7QMdzw&list=PLErOmyzRKOCr07Kcnx75Aqh6PWSbIokPB)

As the class currently uses Angular version >=19, we will assume standalone components by default. You can read more about them at the Angular Guide for [Anatomy of a Component](https://angular.dev/guide/components).
